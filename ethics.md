## Scenario #2: My company's customers' personal data ##

**Understanding the scenario**

* When I joined Beerz, the CTO’s promise that user data would only be used as needed and discarded immediately afterward was a primary reason for my interest.
I appreciated Beerz's stance against surveillance capitalism, focusing instead on user privacy.
However, during my presentation of new feature ideas for Beerz 2.0, things took an unexpected turn.

* The CEO proposed putting a hold on data scrubbing to consider selling anonymized location data, this contadicts the company's original ethical stance.
Then, a colleague mentioned that user location data might already be stored in API logs due to the use of GET parameters, which added another layer of concern.
Not only was this ethically alarming, but it also potentially undermined the CTO's original commitment to user privacy.

**Main ethical questions**

* Should I proceed with implementing the Beerz 2.0 features I suggested under the CEO's request to delay data scrubbing, even if it conflicts with the ethical foundation that initially attracted me to Beerz?

* How should I address the potential users' privacy risks, given that user location data may have been retained in the logs all along?

**Stakeholders and their rights**

* Customers: Right to privacy of their personal data, especially  given that Beerz initially committed to discarding their location data promptly.

* Employees/developing team (including me):  Right to work under ethical conditions and be informed if there are changes in the company's principles from those originally presented to us.

* CTO: Right to uphold the vision she promoted, which includes her pitch on data privacy.

* CEO: Right to make decisions in the best interest of the company and explore new revenue-generating strategies

**Missing information**

* I need clarification on whether data retention in archived logs is intentional or a byproduct of bugs (or if the clueless fellow was not credible). Knowing this would help determine whether data privacy has been inadvertently compromised from the start.

*  I would like more insight into the specific legal regulations that Beerz is subject to regarding data retention and user consent.

**Possible actions and consequences**

* Advocate for data scrubbing: This approach aligns with the CTO’s vision and maintains user trust, but it may conflict with the CEO’s goals to generate additional revenue for the company and potentially strain my relationship with management.

* Submit my resignation to Beerz: This would be a valid approach since the company is violating the privacy commitment that led me to desire working for them. However, this would be a coward approach since neither would I be helping enhance customers' privacy nor would I have a job :(

**Relevant ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct**

* ***Section 1.1 - Be honest and trustworthy***: The CEO’s suggestion to generate revenue from customers' location data conflicts with the CTO’s promise to avoid surveillance capitalism. Transparency with users about data practices is very important.
* ***Section 1.6 - Respect privacy***:  Customers' information should only be used for legitimate purposes, with protection against unauthorized access. Holding onto location data for potential resale violates this code and could lead to re-identification risks.
* ***Section 2.2 - Maintain high standards of professional competence, conduct and ethical practice***:
As an employee who presented the new features, I am bound by this code, which could be compromised if I comply with the CEO’s proposal.
* ***Section 3.1 - Ensure that the public good is the central concern during all professional computing work***: This section suggests that the CEO’s approach to monetizing data without clear user consent would be unethical, as it prioritizes profit over users' data privacy.

**Recommended action**

Based on my analysis, my recommended action is to engage the CTO in a discussion about the CEO’s proposal, as she aligns with my ethical concerns. I would advocate for reinforcing the data scrubbing policy as initially promised, emphasizing that this approach maintains user trust and aligns with the company’s original vision. 

The ACM Code of Ethics supports a commitment to privacy and trustworthiness, reinforcing that our primary responsibility is to our customers and their rights. If the company decides to prioritize profit over ethics, I would consider seeking employment elsewhere, as I value companies that respect user privacy and adhere to ethical standards. 


This report underscores that ethical computing practices should not be compromised, even in pursuit of revenue, especially when they could harm the very users we aim to serve.
