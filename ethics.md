## Scenario #2: My company's customers' personal data ##

**Understanding the scenario**

* When I joined Beerz, the CTOâ€™s promise that user data would only be used as needed and discarded immediately afterward was a primary reason for my interest.
I appreciated Beerz's stance against surveillance capitalism, focusing instead on user privacy.
However, during my presentation of new feature ideas for Beerz 2.0, things took an unexpected turn.

* The CEO proposed putting a hold on data scrubbing to consider selling anonymized location data, this contadicts the company's original ethical stance.
Then, a colleague mentioned that user location data might already be stored in API logs due to the use of GET parameters, which added another layer of concern.
Not only was this ethically alarming, but it also potentially undermined the CTO's original commitment to user privacy.

**Main ethical questions**

* Should I proceed with implementing the Beerz 2.0 features I suggested under the CEO's request to delay data scrubbing,
  even if it conflicts with the ethical foundation that initially attracted me to Beerz?

* How should I address the potential users' privacy risks, given that user location data may have been retained in the logs all along?

**Stakeholders and their rights**

* Customers: Right to privacy of their personal data, especially  given that Beerz initially committed to discarding their location data promptly.

* Employees/developing team (including me):  Right to work under ethical conditions and be informed if there are changes in the company's principles from those originally
  presented to us.

* CTO: Right to uphold the vision she promoted, which includes her pitch on data privacy.

* CEO: Right to make decisions in the best interest of the company and explore new revenue-generating strategies
