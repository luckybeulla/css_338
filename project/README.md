# A project: learn something new and share it

## Project Topic: Interactive key sharing visualization web app

## Partners: 

* Bryan
* Lucky

## Project Description:

We want to build a web app that visually demonstrates public key exchange using interactive animations and diagrams. This app will allow users to select values and view a step-by-step breakdown of key sharing processes, specifically Diffie-Hellman. Additionally, the app will illustrate scenarios such as adversary-in-the-middle attacks.

## Project Deliverables:

An interactive interface with the following elements:
 - Components representing each participant in the key exchange, such as Alice, Bob, and Mal/Eve.
 - A breakdown of key sharing with explanations and scenarios involving an eavesdropper or AITM .
 - Illustrations of transforming a Diffie-Hellman shared secret into an AES key (if time allows)
   
The attached sketch below provides a rough idea of our layout: users can see separate interfaces for each participant (e.g., Alice and Bob) and observe how messages and keys pass through a public network. 

If time allows, we will also have an "Encrypt Using" button that gives the user an option to choose between key exchange protocols (e.g., Diffie-Hellman or RSA).
