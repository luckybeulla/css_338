1. Identify the parts of the TCP 3-way handshake by listing the frame summaries of the relevant frames. Your summaries should looks something like this:
3  10.0.2.15  129.6.15.27  TCP  [SYN]...
(i.e. the frame number 3, the source IP address, the destination IP address, the protocol, and the "Info" for the frame).


2. What port number does the client (i.e. nc on your Kali computer) use for this interaction?
3. Why does the client need a port?
4. What frame contains the actual date and time? (Show the frame summary as in question 1 above.)
5. What do [SYN] and [ACK] mean?
6. Which entity (the nc client or the daytime server) initiated the closing of the TCP connection? How can you tell?
